  <h1>The Chrome Debugger</h1>

    <p>
      The Chrome browser includes a variety of useful tools. Here now begin to explore them in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "debugging" feature is among the most useful features Chrome supports. It allows us to step inside of our code while
      it runs and see how it behaves. It can show us what values are getting assigned to different variables as well as what functions are
      being called and in what order.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll start by telling the browser to "pause" our code in a specific place. To begin, we have to tell it WHERE to pause.
    </p>
    <p>First, open up your old "functions.js" exercises. Then open the browser console with option + command + j. At the top of the screen you'll see a tab labeled "sources". Click it.</p>

    <p>
      Look at the section on the left. Look at the files and folders listed there. You're looking at a breakdown of all the different js/css/html
      functions.html explicitly includes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, navigate to your solution for the exercise on "callback". You chould be looking at your code for "doArithmetic".
    </p>

    <p>
      To set a "breakpoint" (the flag we're setting to "pause" the code) in chrome we click the line on the numbers on the left side.
      Select any line INSIDE of "doArithmetic" and set a "breakpoint" there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, click the "test code" button for the callback section. This will run "doArithmetic". You'll see the following:
