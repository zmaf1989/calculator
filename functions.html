  <h1>Callbacks</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      Functions can be used in all sorts of different ways. We can think of
      uses that are conceptually similar as a "pattern".
    </p>
    <p>
      The first "pattern" we'll start with is what is known as a "callback" function.
      A "callback" is a function that is passed to another function as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the example below:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const callbackFunctionOne = () => {
        console.log('The first callback function is running.')
      }
      
      const callbackFunctionTwo = () => {
        console.log('The second callback function is running.')
      }
      
      const parentFunction = (cb) => {
        console.log('The parent function is running.')
      
        // Since 'cb' is just an agument, it can be anything.
        cb()
      }

      parentFunction(callbackFunctionOne)
      parentFunction(callbackFunctionTwo)
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you copy/paste that code into the browser console you'll see the messages logged.
      ("option + command + j")
    </p>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: doArithmetic</h4>
      <p>
        Complete the function "doArithmetic" in functions.js. "doArithmetic" will accept
        a number as well as two "callback" functions. It will pass the number to the callback
        functions in order and return the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        var result = doArithmetic(6, divideByTwo, multiplyByThree)

        if (result === 9) {
          console.log('doArithmetic works as-expected')
        } else {
          console.log('doArithmetic is broken')
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, "divideByTwo" and "multiplyByThree" would be callbacks specified elsewhere.
