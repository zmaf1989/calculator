  <h1>Callbacks</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      Functions can be used in all sorts of different ways. We can think of
      uses that are conceptually similar as a "pattern".
    </p>
    <p>
      The first "pattern" we'll start with is what is known as a "callback" function.
      A "callback" is a function that is passed to another function as an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the example below:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const callbackFunctionOne = () => {
        console.log('The first callback function is running.')
      }
      
      const callbackFunctionTwo = () => {
        console.log('The second callback function is running.')
      }
      
      const parentFunction = (cb) => {
        console.log('The parent function is running.')
      
        // Since 'cb' is just an agument, it can be anything.
        cb()
      }

      parentFunction(callbackFunctionOne)
      parentFunction(callbackFunctionTwo)
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you copy/paste that code into the browser console you'll see the messages logged.
      ("option + command + j")
    </p>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: doArithmetic</h4>
      <p>
        Complete the function "doArithmetic" in callback.js. "doArithmetic" will accept
        a number as well as two "callback" functions. It will pass the number to the callback
        functions in order and return the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        var result = doArithmetic(6, divideByTwo, multiplyByThree)

        if (result === 9) {
          console.log('doArithmetic works as-expected')
        } else {
          console.log('doArithmetic is broken')
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, "divideByTwo" and "multiplyByThree" would be callbacks specified elsewhere.
      </p>

  <h1>Functions that Return Functions</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      Some functions return other functions when called.
    </p>
    <pre>
      const parentFun = () => {
        console.log('The parent function is running.')

        const childFun = () => {
          console.log('The child function is running.')
        }

        return childFun
      }
      
      // The 'parent' will log once
      const test = parentFun()

      // The 'child' will log twice
      test()
      test()
    </pre>
    <p>
      By itself, this might not seem that useful. However, the advangage of doing this will become clear in the next lesson on "Closures".
    </p>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: plusFive</h4>
      <p>
        Complete the function "plusFive" in funreturn.js. When called, "plusFive" 
        will return a function that adds five to any number passed as an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        var addFive = plusFive()
        var result = addFive(10)

        // This should log 15
        console.log(result)
      </pre>
      <div class="code-results" id="funreturn-exercise-results">
        Test Case:
        <pre class="code-results-test-case" id="funreturn-exercise-test-case"></pre>
        Results:
        <div class="code-results-output" id="funreturn-exercise-output"></div>
        <button id="funreturn-exercise-button">Test Code</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Closures</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      This is where things get complicated. Put "simply", a "closure" is some sort of private, internal value a function can access.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what the hell does that mean? It's easier to understand looking at code. Consider this example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const parentFun = () => {
        let count = 0

        const childFun = () => {
          count++
          console.log(`current count: ${count}`)
        }

        return childFun
      }
      
      // The 'parent' will return a new function every time it's called
      const test1 = parentFun()
      const test2 = parentFun()

      // count will be 2
      test1()
      test1()

      // count will be 1
      test2()
    </pre>
    <p>
      Outwardly, this example is very similar to the one use in "Functions that return Functions".
      There is one key difference however: notice the variable "count" created within "parentFun".
    </p>
    <p>
      This variable is created EVERY TIME "parentFun" is run, meaning every function returned by "parentFun"
      will retain its own, unique "count" variable. "count" is a closure.
    </p>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: equationBuilder</h4>
      <p>
        Remember the "doArithmetic" exercise above? Yeah, we're doing to juice that up on closures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complete the function "equationBuilder" in closure.js. "equationBuilder" accepts two "arithmetic" 
        functions as arguments and returns a function that will apply them on a number when called. For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        var divideByFour = equationBuilder(divideByTwo, divideByTwo)
        var result = divideByFour(8)

        // This should log 2
        console.log(result)
      </pre>
      <div class="code-results" id="closure-exercise-results">
        Test Case:
        <pre class="code-results-test-case" id="closure-exercise-test-case"></pre>
        Results:

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Iterators</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      This next section will involve arrays and loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put simply, an "iterator" is a function that will be called once on every single value stored in an array. If an array has a length of 8, the iterator will be called eight times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time the "iterator" is called it accepts one of the values stored in the array as an argument. Consider this example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const anArray = ['mincemeat', 'involuntary basejumping', 'a big bag of tumors']

      const anIterator = (value) => {
        console.log(value)
      }

      const aFunctionThatUsesIterator = (arr, iterator) => {
        for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          let value = arr[i]
          iterator(value)
        }
      }

      // This will log every value in 'anArray'
      aFunctionThatUsesIterator(anArray, anIterator)
    </pre>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: doMathOnArray</h4>
      <p>
        Create a function that accepts an array of numbers and an iterator. "doMathOnArray" will call the iterator on each number in the 
        array and store the result in the same location in the array (this means the original value will be overwritten). For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const anArray = [4, 2, 6, 8, 1]

        doMathOnArray(anArray, multiplyByThree)

        // This will log [12, 6, 18, 24, 3]
        console.log(anArray)
      </pre>
      <div class="code-results" id="iterator-exercise-results">
        Test Case:
        <pre class="code-results-test-case" id="iterator-exercise-test-case"></pre>
        Results:
        <div class="code-results-output" id="iterator-exercise-output"></div>
        <button id="iterator-exercise-button">Test Code</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: filterNumbers</h4>
      <p>
        This second exercise is slightly different. Here, we'll be creating a function a returns a completely new array rather than modifying the old one.
        A correct answer should leave the original array unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a function 'filterNumbers' that accepts an array of numbers and an iterator. The iterator will perform some sort of check on each number
        in the array and return 'true' or 'false'. 'filterNumbers' should return an array containing only the values which 'pass' the iterator's check.
        For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        // It literally just checks if a number is six. Returns true/false.
        const isSix = (num) => {
          return num === 6
        }

        const anArray = [4, 2, 6, 8, 1, 6]

        const result = filterNumbers(anArray, isSix)

        // This will log [4, 2, 6, 8, 1, 6]. "anArray" is unchanged.
        console.log(anArray)

        // This will log [6, 6]
        console.log(result)
      </pre>
      <div class="code-results" id="iteratorB-exercise-results">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Recursion</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      A "recursive" function is a function that calls itself. Conceptually, recursion can look a lot like the iterator functions we've already worked with.
      They're similiar in the respect that a function is called multiple times, each time with a new value until some sort of end-state is reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice however, the code we end up writing is markedly different. Recursive functions are a powerful tool that can be used in all sorts of interesting ways;
      there are types of problems we'd be hard-pressed to solve without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few ideas common to practically all recursive functions, the most important of all being the "end condition", which is some sort of check
      that tells the function when it's reached the desired result and it should stop calling itself. Conceptually, you can think of this as being the
      same as the middle "i < arr.length" condition in the following loop: "for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)".
    </p>
    <p>
      As you already say for youself during an earlier exercise, a function that calls itself without some sort of "end condition" will go on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a moment to look over the following example. Note the "end condition". Note how each time the recursive function is called, it has different input.
    </p>
    <pre>
      // "splitCount" returns the number of times a number can be divided in half without returning a number less than one.
      const splitCount = (num, callCount = 0) => {
        const half = num / 2

        // This is our "end condition".
        if (half < 1) {
          return callCount
        } else {
          // This is where we "recurse". Note how both arguments will change with each call.
          return splitCount(half, callCount + 1)
        }
      }

      const result = splitCount(10)

      // The result will be 3, since 10 can only be divided in half 3 times before the results are less than one.
      console.log(result)
    </pre>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: powerOf</h4>
      <p>
        Write a recursive function "powerOF" that accepts a number and an exponent and returns the result. For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const result = powerOf(3, 5)

        // result will be 243
        console.log(result)
      </pre>
      <p>
        It's worth noting here that you could also accomplish this task without using recursion. Don't do it. Don't use an iterator.
        "powerOf" should call itself. (A hint: powerOf may need to accept more than two arguments to work.)
      </p>
      <div class="code-results" id="recursion-exercise-results">
        Test Case:

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h1>Methods, Decorators and Factories</h1>
  <div class="lesson-section">
    <p>
      A "method" is a function attached to an object. That's literally it. There's some complexity here we're choosing to ignore for now. We'll cover it when we get to "classes".
    </p>
    <p>
      Methods can be set like any other key on an object. Once set, they can be called like any other function.
    </p>
    <pre>
      const anObject = {
        someNum1: 10
      }

      const add = (num1, num2) => {
        return num1 + num2
      }

      // Notice how the 'key' can be whatever we want. It doesn't have to match the function variable name.
      anObject.someMethodName = add
      anObject.someNum2 = 5

      anObject.someNum3 = anObject.someMethodName(anObject.someNum1, anObject.someNum2)

      // anObject will have 4 keys. Three will be numbers. One will be a method.
      console.log(anObject)
    </pre>
    <p>
      A "decorator" is a function that accepts an already-existing object (or array) and attaches additional keys and values onto it.
    </p>
    <pre>
      const personObj = {
        name: 'Roscoe',
        age: 45,
        smoker: true,
        obese: true,
        ownsTigers: false
      }

      const morbidityDecorator = (person) => {
        const AVERAGE_AGE_OF_DEATH = 75

        // I know you've never seen this syntax before. This is short-hand for assiging keys & values one-by-one. IE "const age = person.age" etc...
        const { age, smoker, obese, ownsTigers } = person
        let yearsRemaining = AVERAGE_AGE_OF_DEATH - age

        if (smoker) {
          yearsRemaining -= (yearsRemaining / 4)
        }

        if (obese) {
          yearsRemaining -= (yearsRemaining / 4)
        }

        if (ownsTigers) {
          yearsRemaining -= (yearsRemaining / 2)
        }

        person.probableAgeOfDeath = parseInt(age + yearsRemaining)
      }

      morbidityDecorator(personObj)
      
      // probableAgeOfDeath is 61. Notice that we didn't return anything OR re-assign "personObj" but the object is still changed. This is worth
      // discussing further if you don't understand why.
      console.log(personObj)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Finally, a 'factory' function is a function that accepts some values and "builds" a new object.
    </p>
    <pre>
      const humanCloningMaching = (name) => {
        // Again, new syntax. The way I'm using "name" here is the same as writing: {name: name}
        const newHuman = {
          name,
          age: 0,
          smoker: false,
          obese, false,
          ownsTigers: false
        }

        return newHuman
      }

      const pete = humanCloningMaching('Pete')
      const frank = humanCloningMaching('Frank')

      // This will log an object with a name of 'frank'
      console.log(frank)
    </pre>
    <div class="code-exercise-section">
      <h4>Exercise: keyList</h4>
      <p>
        Create a "decorator" function called "keyList" that accepts an object as an argument. keyList will attach an array named "listOfKeys" to the 
        object containing - you guessed it - all the keys on the object EXCEPT listOfKeys. An example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const obj1 = {
          foo: true,
          bar: false
        }

        const obj2 = {}

        keyList(obj1)
        keyList(obj2)

        // logs ['foo', 'bar']
        console.log(obj1.listOfKeys)

        // logs []
        console.log(obj2.listOfKeys)
      </pre>
      <p>
        Additionally, calling "keyList" multiple times on the same object should NEVER result in "listOfKeys" listing itself.
